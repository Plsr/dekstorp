# Dekstorp

A try at building an OS in the browser, indpired by [Dustin Brett](https://dustinbrett.com/). No goals or purpose, just me playing around to see if I can do it.

## Stuff that could be done
- [ ] Better drag preview when dragging a window around
- [ ] Allow minimizing of apps from title bar
- [ ] Allow maximazing apps from task bar
- [ ] Add context menu to task bar and allow closing applications from there
- [ ] Allow maximizing applications from task and menu bar
